                    My name is Nico and I am a Junior Web Developer.
                    Even if I have always been interested in coding and programming, my background is a bit uncommon 
                    because during the first years of university I studied economics and then I graduated from University of Bologna in 2018 with a
                    Master's Degree in Finance. After that I started my journey in Australia where
                    I achieved a Master in Business Administration at Kaplan Business School, Melbourne.
                    During the Master, I got into project managment aspects that fascinated me so whilst there 
                    I completed various extra courses regarding that, in a way to combine
                    economics and management skills.
                    Once the Master was over, I decided to fulfill my old passion and I dove into coding
                     by enrolling at the Monash University Coding Bootcamp.
